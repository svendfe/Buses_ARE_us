# Buses-R-Us
Software Construction (CPSC 210) final project

-A map Android application that marks stops and bus routes in the Greater Vancouver Transit system (Translink), retrieves real time arrival information at stops, plots userâ€™s location on the map, and highlights the nearest stop.

-Used UML class diagrams to implement associations between Java classes, wrote and executed extensive unit tests for robust classes in jUnit and built multiple parsers. Used multiple algorithms and data structures to store and display the information in the map.
